                <p> When I first joined CIS I couldn’t fit in, I felt like I didn’t belong here. </p>
                <p> But as time passed this school has taught me the importance of individuality </p>
                <p> in true sense.You don’t need to be similar to fit here, you need to be different. </p>
                <p> Just one year in this school has taught me about self-discipline, perseverance  </p>
                <p> and responsibility. It has given me opportunities to explore and pursue what </p>
                <p> fascinates me and more importantly it has helped me with my pursuit. </p>

                <p> What I like best about CIS is the individual attention that the teachers and  </p>
                <p> staff gives the students. Teachers are not only interested in my academic progress </p>
                <p> but are also interested in my growth as an individual and have always been around to </p>
                <p> give advice and to support me. There are great facilities and a friendly atmosphere.</p>
                <p> CIS organises multiple events each year which has made my time here really enjoyable. </p>
                <p> There is always something to do at school as there are a wide range of extra curricular </p>
                <p> activities that one can participant in. </p>
